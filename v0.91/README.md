# Small Basic V0.91 is more international than ever!

*Sandra Aldana &ndash; 17 November 2010 10:23*

With 3 more languages available, it was hard for us to hold them to the
next version. So we have released version `0.91` to include Hebrew, Croatian,
and Iberian Portuguese. This brings the count of supported languages to 18!
No functionality has been added or changed from version `v0.9`.

Translated user guides for some of these and other languages can be downloaded
from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ff423682.aspx).
