# Small Basic 1.0 is here!

*Sandra Aldana &ndash; 12 July 2011 16:08*

After more than two years of pre-release versions of Small Basic, we are
finally releasing the `1.0` version. Although we know that there a number
of features we still haven't implemented, we feel that Small Basic now has
a solid set of core features that make it useful to beginners. We hope to
get everyone onto the `1.0` version so that we have a common baseline to
move forward.

Over the past few months, we have been focused largely on our online
experience and also the Small Basic translation efforts. There is a huge
demand for Small Basic outside the US, and so we want to help beginners
in other parts of the world to get started in programming. Here's what's
new:

- **Small Basic 1.0** &ndash; Small Basic 1.0 is a minor update to version
  `0.95` with the following changes:
  
    - The Icelandic language was added through the great work of a volunteer
      in the community. (Thanks to Jon B Georgsson!) The addition of Icelandic
      brings us to **20 languages**. That's pretty amazing and demonstrates
      both the strong demand for local versions of Small Basic for and also
      the great support we have from the global Small Basic community.
      
    - We updated the Small Basic setup and version information.
    
    - Some editorial bugs were fixed in the strings used by Small Basic.
    
    - The End User License Agreement (EULA) has been updated to reflect that
      Small Basic is no longer considered "Pre-Release" software.
      
Although we haven't really added new features in `1.0`, besides Icelandic, we
do have a list of feature requests from users, and we are looking at how we can
add them in the future. I also want to let you know about some new Small Basic
extensions from our friends at the 
[TeachingKidsProgramming](http://www.teachingkidsprogramming.com/) website.

[TeachingKidsProgramming](http://www.teachingkidsprogramming.com/) provides free
courseware to introduce kids (ages 10+) to programming. New in this compatible
release of the Small Basic Fun extensions 
([extendsmallbasic.codeplex.com/](http://extendsmallbasic.codeplex.com/)) is a
recipe **"(m)adLibs"** which you can use to introduce the MVC pattern to your
kids. It includes several new objects, such as a `Viewer` and a `Parser` to
support teaching of this pattern.

- **New Small Basic website on MSDN** &ndash; A lot of work has gone into
  re-creating the Small Basic website. We hope you will find it useful. In
  addition to a new look and cleaner design, we have also patnered with [Computer
  Science for Kids](http://computerscienceforkids.com/default.aspx) to publish
  sample chapters from several of their Small Basic E-books on our site. We hope
  you will find these high-quality guides useful for learning and having fun with
  Small Basic.
  
- **Translated Curriculum** &ndash; We've been receiving requests from abroad for
  translated versions of our teaching curriculum. So over the last several months
  we have put a lot of effort into making this curriculum available in more
  languages. This is a work in progress as some languages still have English
  screenshots, but we do now have all languages translated. You can find the
  curriculum [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/hh314609.aspx).
  
Finally, we'd like to thank the Small Basic community for your passion around this
product and for teaching young people the joys of computer programming. The Small
Basic Virtual Team shares your passion, and we look forward to our continued
partnership on this project.
