# Small Basic v0.95 speaks another language!

*Sandra Aldana &ndash; 8 February 2011 09:47*

Czech is now part of the Small Basic family and it is released for the first
time in this latest version `0.95`. We also updated some of the Korean strings
after receiving some great feedback from one teacher from Korean. No
functionality has been added or changed from version `0.9`.

Translated Czech user guide will be available in the next few weeks
