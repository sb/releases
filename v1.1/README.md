*Ed Price &ndash; 27 March 2015 17:10*

Starting last year, we began the journey of continuing development on
Microsoft Small Basic. It's a new team assembled across Microsoft in a
new world of devices and platforms.

As you can imagine, we're taking one step at a time. This is not a large
step, but it's an important step. Please join us in trying out Small Basic
1.1, and post your feedback in the comments below!

We now offer two choices for downloading Microsoft Small Basic:

- Small Basic 1.1 - If you're using Windows 7 / windows Vista or newer
  operating systems
- Small Basic 1.0 - If you're using Windows XP or prior operating
  systems.
  

### Microsoft Small Basic 1.1

Small Basic 1.1 is upgraded to .NET Framework 4.5, and it includes a fix
to the Flickr API bug (1.0-17). It is compatible with Windows 10 Tech
Preview, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and
Windows Vista. If you have Windows XP, you'll need to download Small Basic
1.0. Any extensions built for Small Basic 1.0 will need to be rebuilt on
Small Basic 1.1 You have two options to download:

  the other languages are still available through the English installation

### Microsoft Small Basic 1.0

Small Basic 1.0 is compatible with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, and
older operating systems. It requires .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. It does not
include the Flickr API fix in Small Basic 1.1. You have two options to
download:

  the other languages are still available through the English installation
  wizard.

### What's New in Microsoft Small Basic 1.1

#### New Updates

- **NET Framework 4.5** &ndash; We upgraded to .NET Framework 4.5 from 3.5
  SP1. Although this causes some breaking changes (see below), it's necessary
  in order to build out new objects that take advantage of new devices,
  operating systems, and capabilities.
- **Modernized UX: Controls** &ndash; The design of the program controls
  (button, scroll bar, arrows on the control bar) in the `GraphicsWindow` is
  now flat (modernized). And the window title font is also updated.
- **Language Downloads** &ndash; You can now directly download your language
  from the Download Center. See the Download Center Page.
  
  
#### Bug Fixes

- **Flickr Object (1.0-17)** &ndash; Flickr changed their API, which broke the
  Flickr Object. This has been fixed for Small Basic 1.1.
  
  
#### Breaking Changes

- **Windows XP** &ndash; Due to the upgrade to .NET Framework 4.5, Small Basic 1.1
  does not work on Windows XP and older operating systems. We will continue to offer
  Small Basic 1.0 for users of Windows XP and older operating systems.
  
- **1.0 Extensions** &ndash; All extensions built for Small Basic 1.0 will need to
  be recompiled on Small Basic 1.1 and re-released.
  
  
### Other Changes

We're experimenting with modernizing the graphics. Currently it affected the
installation wizard, with some temporary modernized images. These will be updated
again in future releases.


### System Requirements

- **Supported Operating Systems:** Windows 10 Tech Preview, Windows 8.1, Windows 8,
  Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista (and Mac OS X through software
  such as *Parallels Desktop 10 for Mac*).
  
- **.Net Framework 4.5:** Required for Windows 7 and Windows Vista. It comes installed
  on Windows 8 and newer.
  
  
### Installation Instructions

1. If you have Small Basic 1.0 installed, uninstall it. You'll need to delete all the
   files in the `smallbasic` folder.
   
    - NOTE: If you previously set your web browser to block the 
      `C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft` folder, you will need to remove that
      block.
      
2. Download and Install Microsoft Small Basic in your preferred language.

3. Launch by clicking the Microsoft Small Basic program shortcut.
