*Vijaye Raji &ndash; 23 October 2009 10:54*

Marking the first year anniversary since it went public, we're announcing
the 7th release of Small Basic CTP. This release adds localised support to
four new languages, extending Small Basic's reach to Chinese, French, German,
Italian, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish!

In addition, this release sports a cool new feature called "Graduate", that
allows you to port your Small Basic program seamlessly to Visual Basic.
