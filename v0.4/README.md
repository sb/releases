# v0.4 of Small Basic says "Bonjour"

*Vijaye Raji &ndash; 14 April 2009 13:42*

Here it is, finally, the next installment of Small Basic CTP. Once again,
the new v0.4 version comes with a lot of bug fixes, and a new `Timer` object
that makes writing games easier. What really excites me with this release
is that Small Basic is completely localizable, and as a start, we've localized
the UI and Library Help in French!

The localization was a community driven effort. *Sandra Aldana* and *Dioni de
Morena Morales* have been the main co-ordinators behind the effort and I'd like
to thank them for all their efforts. In addition, the French translation was
provided by *Thierry Huguet* (Microsoft) and *Fabien Lavocat* (Microsoft
Intern). Many thanks to them too!

The localized document will be released out of band as they arrive. If you
want to participate in the localization efforts, please feel free to contact me.
